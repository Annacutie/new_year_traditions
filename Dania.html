Happy New Year! Danes traditionally celebrate New Year with loads of fireworks, and one of the best places to see it is along the lakes in Copenhagen</p>
<p>New Year’s Eve is your chance to say goodbye to old year, to throw off that novelty Christmas jumper Farmor (granny!) knitted you and don your best suit and tie, ready for a night of revelling. The evening signifies a renewal process; it’s a fresh start, the dawning of a new page in the calendar, so naturally we celebrate this special occasion by doing exactly the same thing we did last year.</p>
<p>In some parts of the world they ring in the New Year with some very choice rituals indeed. In Spain, people mark the occasion by eating a grape every chime of midnight, meanwhile the Irish bang loaves of bread on their doors and walls, and in Turkey, it is customary to wear red undies beneath your party outfit for good luck.</p>
<p>The Danes are no strangers to quaint, some may say bizarre, New Year’s Eve traditions. So we’ve rounded up the best of these annual customs for your amusement. We’ve enlisted a real life Dane and self-proclaimed New Year-ologist, Alex Aagaard, to assist us in giving you an authentic low down on all the night’s happenings.</p>
